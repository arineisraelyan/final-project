The highest average temperature was registered in Vazgen Sargsyan school area (24.3 C).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next chart shows the count of humidity of each area. 100% means that it was raining. The lowest average one is Vazgen Sargsyan school area (36.2%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the data we explored was not enough to make decisions, but according to it the driest and hottest place in Late Spring-Summer among the places we discussed is Vazgen Sargsyan school area in Yerevan.
