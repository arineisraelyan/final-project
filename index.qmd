Welcome to Risk and spread of fire website. The goal of this site is to find the probability of starting fire and the direction of spreading fire in different areas of Armenia.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("humidity_danger_animation.gif")
```

We will explore 8 areas: Artik, Ashotsk, Azatan, Gavar, Maralik, Panik, Sevan and Vazgen Sargsyan school (Yerevan). We will see which area is the driest, hottest, how does the speed of wind change over time and which direction it blows in each area. This website can help people to be aware of upcoming hot and dry weather and to know which direction will the started fire spread, to be safe and put it out more easily.

You can open the Data Analysis page at the top to view each area and conclusion of the exploration.
