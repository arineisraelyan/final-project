Artik is a town in the Artik Municipality of the Shirak Province of Armenia.

### Fire causes and risk

Now we will explore the fire causes probability in Artik, going through data provided by Tumo Climate Net. The main climate features that can cause fire are temperature and humidity. The fire cause probability is higher when the temperature is high and humidity is low. The graph below represents the temperature and humidity flow during May-July 2024. As you can see, there is no information in the start of June, because the device was broken. Dangerous humidity levels were registered from the middle of June to the start of July.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
# p1 <- artik |> drop_na() |> ggplot(aes(x=time, y=temperature)) + geom_line(color="darkblue") + geom_smooth(color="white") + theme_minimal() + labs(subtitle="Dangerous humidity levels were registered from the middle of June to the start of July", x=NULL, y="Temperatue", title="Temperature and Humidity in Artik") + scale_x_datetime(
#     limits = c(as.POSIXct("2024-05-23 00:00"), as.POSIXct("2024-07-15 00:00")),
#     date_labels = "%b %d"
#   )
# 
# p2 <- artik |> drop_na() |> ggplot(aes(x=time, y=humidity)) + geom_line(aes(color=if_else(humidity<30,"too_low", "normal")))+ scale_color_manual(values = c("too_low"="red", normal="orange"), guide="none") + theme_minimal() + labs(x="Time", y="Humidity") + scale_x_datetime(
#     limits = c(as.POSIXct("2024-05-23 00:00"), as.POSIXct("2024-07-15 00:00")),
#     date_labels = "%b %d"
#   )
# 
# combined_plot <- p1/p2

#ggsave(combined_plot, filename="artik_first.png", limitsize = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("artik_first.png")
```

Humidity level is considered to be low when lower than 30 percents. The graph below represents the humidity level in Artik when the temperature is above 30 C (May-July 2024).

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(lubridate)

p <- artik |> drop_na() |> filter(temperature > 30) |> mutate(humidity_level = factor(if_else(humidity < 30, "Too low", "Normal"))) |> ggplot(aes(x = time, y = temperature, alpha = 0.5)) + geom_point(aes(color = humidity_level)) + scale_color_manual(values = c("Too low" = "firebrick1", "Normal" = "steelblue1")) + theme_bw() + labs(title="Humidity level in Artik", subtitle="Humidity levels are lower than normal", color = "Humidity level", x = "Time", y = "Temperature") + scale_alpha_continuous(guide = "none") + scale_x_datetime(
    limits = c(as.POSIXct("2024-05-23 00:00"), as.POSIXct("2024-07-15 00:00")),
    date_labels = "%b %d"
  )

ggplotly(p)

```

### Predicting the spread of fire

We never know when and where will start the fire, so predicting the fire spreading speed and direction would be helpful to put it out. In the graph below you can see the wind speed during May-July 2024. As you can see, there is not much danger, only at the end of May and at the start of July.

```{r message=FALSE}
# windplot <- artik |> drop_na() |> ggplot(aes(x=time, y=speed)) + geom_jitter(aes(color=if_else(speed<15,"normal", "too_high"), alpha=0.5))+ scale_color_manual(values = c("normal"="black", too_high="darkred"), labels=c("normal"="Normal Speed", "too_high"="High Speed")) + scale_alpha_continuous(guide = "none") + geom_smooth(color="white") + theme_minimal() + labs(title="Wind speed in Artik", x ="Time", y="Speed", color="Wind speed") + scale_x_datetime(
#     limits = c(as.POSIXct("2024-05-23 00:00"), as.POSIXct("2024-07-15 00:00")),
#     date_labels = "%b %d"
#   )
# 
# ggsave(windplot, filename="artik_wind.png", limitsize = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("artik_wind.png")
```

It is important to predict the direction of fire spread as well. Here is a chart representing the count of each of wind direction. As you can see, the wind often blows from East and South-East.

```{r message=FALSE}
order <- c("NE", "E", "SE", "S", "SW", "W", "NW", "N")

# p_circular <- artik |> drop_na() |> mutate(direction = factor(direction, levels = order)) |>
#   ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(direction))) + 
#   geom_bar(fill="skyblue4") + coord_polar(start = 0) +
#   theme_minimal() +
#   theme(
#     axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),
#     axis.title.x = element_blank(),  
#     axis.title.y = element_blank(), 
#     panel.grid = element_blank(),
#     plot.background = element_blank()
#   ) + labs(title="Wind direction counts in Artik", subtitle="The wind often blows from East and South-East")
# 
# ggsave(p_circular, filename="artik_direction.png", limitsize = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("artik_direction.png")

# start_date <- as.POSIXct('2024-05-23 00:00')
# end_date <- as.POSIXct('2024-07-15 00:00')
# 
# filtered_data <- artik |>
#   filter(time >= start_date & time <= end_date)
# 
# column_values <- filtered_data[["temperature"]]
# column_values_numeric <- as.numeric(column_values)
# mean_value <- mean(column_values_numeric, na.rm = TRUE)
#print(mean_value)
```

### Conclusion of Artik area

According to the data we explored, Artik is not that hot and dry place, and fire cause probability is normal. The average temperature in Artik in May-July is about 19.7 C, and the average humidity is about 55.9%, which is considered normal.

Wind speed is not that high, and it usually blows from East and South-East, so the fire probably spreads to West and North-West.
